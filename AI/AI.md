# General concepts

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Refers to the ability of machines or computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 

### Capabilities
AI can perform various tasks, such as:
1. Recognizing speech (like virtual assistants)
2. Understanding natural language (like chatbots)
3. Analyzing data to find patterns (like fraud detection)
4. Making predictions (like weather forecasting)

## Foundation Models (FMs)
Foundation models are like the building blocks of artificial intelligence.

A foundation model in AI is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on a large and diverse dataset, allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks.

## Machine learning (ML)
ML is a subset of AI that involves training on historical data, such as banking transactions, to detect patterns like fraud.

## Deep learning
DL uses large datasets (e.g., images) for tasks like object recognition in self-driving cars, and generative AI, which creates new content based on learned patterns.

## Hallucinations
Hallucinations are instances where AI generates incorrect, fabricated or nonsensical information that appear plausible, but are not based on reality or accurate data.

## Prompt Engineering

## Data
Data is like the food that helps artificial intelligence (AI) grow and learn. Just as plants need water and sunlight to thrive, AI needs data to understand the world and make decisions. Without data, AI wouldn't know what to do!

## Types of Data
Data can be sourced from various places, including:
1. Publicly Available Sources: Websites, articles, and books.
2. Private Business Records: Banking transactions, device sensors, etc.
