# Introduction
- The AWS Well - Architected Framework is a guide that provides a consistent approach to evaluate cloud 
architectures. 
- It also provides guidance to help implement designs. 
- It documents a set of foundational questions and best practices you can use to understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best 
practices. AWS developed this framework after reviewing thousands of customer architectures on AWS.
- The AWS Well - Architected Framework is organized into six pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, 
Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.
