# Structural patterns primarily:

- Deal with objects delegating responsibilities to other objects. This results
in a layered architecture of components with low degree of coupling.
- Facilitate interobject communication when one object is not accessible to
the other by normal means or when an object is not usable because of
its incompatible interface.
- Provide ways to structure an aggregate object so that it is created in full
and to reclaim system resources in a timely manner.
