# Serviceability or Manageability
- Another important consideration while designing a distributed system is how easy it is to operate and maintain. 
- Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to fix a failed system increases, then availability will decrease. 
- Things to consider for manageability are the ease of diagnosing and understanding problems when they occur, ease of making updates or modifications, and how simple the system is to operate (i.e., does it routinely operate without failure or exceptions?).
