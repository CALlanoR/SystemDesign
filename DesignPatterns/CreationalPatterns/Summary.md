# Creational Patterns:
- Deal with one of the most commonly performed tasks in an OO application, the creation of objects.
- Support a uniform, simple, and controlled mechanism to create objects.
- Allow the encapsulation of the details about what classes are instantiated and how these instances are created.
- Encourage the use of interfaces, which reduces coupling.
