# Availability
- By definition, availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period. It is a simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or a machine remains operational under normal conditions.
- Availability takes into account maintainability, repair time, spares availability, and other logistics considerations.
- Reliability is availability over time considering the full range of possible real-world conditions that can occur. 

## Reliability Vs. Availability
- If a system is reliable, it is available. However, if it is available, it is not necessarily reliable. In other words, high reliability contributes to high availability, but it is possible to achieve a high availability even with an unreliable product
- Let's take the example of an online retail store that has 99.99% availability for the first two years after its launch. However, the system was launched without any information security testing. The customers are happy with the system, but they don't realize that it isn't very reliable as it is vulnerable to likely risks. In the third year, the system experiences a series of information security incidents that suddenly result in extremely low availability for extended periods of time. This results in reputational and financial damage to the customers.
