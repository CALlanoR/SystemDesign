# Introduction
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

## What is a Software Framework?
A framework often offers some basic functionality that can be used and extented to create applications with 
complex fetures.


## Large Language Model (LLM)
These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity reationships in the language. LLMs use deep learning algorithms to process and understand natural language, performing tasks such as translating, analyzing sentiments, and generating new text.

## Text Embedding
They convert human language (words, sentences, documents) into a point in a multi-dimensional vector space. Texts that are semantically similar (meaning similar things) end up being closer together in this vector space.

## LangChaing
LangChain is an open source framework that facilitates the developer with the necessary tools to create applications powered by LLMs. LangChain is similar to Lego blocks for LLMs.

Benefits:
- Data-aware: LC enables you link your LLM to other data sources including file systems, databases and APIs. 
- Agentic: LC enables you to create agents that employ LLMs to decide what to do and how to do it.

## Agents
Agents combine language models with tools to create systems that can reason about tasks, decide which tools to use, and iteratively work towards solutions.

## Temperature
"Temperature is the dial between PRECISION (0) and CREATIVITY (2)."
