# Internals
- A page is the smallest unit of storage that PostgreSQL reads from or writes to disk. 
    - Visualise it as a big block of storage where you can stuff multiple rows.
- A page is generally 8KB in size(configurable at compile time). 
    - If an average row is ~100 bytes, a single page can hold dozens of rows after accounting for page headers and metadata.
- Each row is called a tuple in PostgreSQL. 
    Both indexes and data are stored in pages.
- An index entry maps a key (id = 10) to a tuple identifier (TID), which identifies the page and offset where the row resides. For example:
    - 10 -> (heap page 30, slot 4).
    - This is stored in B-tree data structure.
- Indexes are persisted on disk and only partially cached in memory. When you create more indexes, you increase the number of index pages competing for space in shared_buffers and the operating system page cache. PostgreSQL does not guarantee that any particular index will remain cached, so simply adding indexes does not ensure faster reads.
- Indexes are persisted on disk and only partially cached in memory.
- LIMIT reduces result size, not execution cost
- SELECT * increases bandwidth and memory usage
    - When you use SELECT *, PostgreSQL must:
        - Fetch all columns from the heap
        - Send all column data to the client
        - Store larger result sets in memory(you get limited memory per connection where results are stored)
    - If a table has wide columns (JSON, text, blobs), this can significantly increase:
        - Network transfer
        - Memory pressure
        - Client-side processing cost
