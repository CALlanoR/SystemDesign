# Amazon Cloud Front
**A content delivery network (CDN)** is a globally distributed system of caching servers. A CDN
caches copies of commonly requested files (static content, such as Hypertext Markup Language,
or HTML; Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS; JavaScript; and image files) that are hosted on the
application origin server. The CDN delivers a local copy of the requested content from a cache
edge or Point of Presence that provides the fastest delivery to the requester.
