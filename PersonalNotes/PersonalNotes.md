1. **You don't need to know everything (having everything memorized).**
    - You just need to know the basics
        - Understanding patterns
        - It's about knowing how to find the answers
        - How to think through problems
        - How to stay calm when nothing works.
2. **Learn how to learn.**
    - Learning to code is like learning a language.
        - You don't become fluent by listening, you become fluent by speaking.
        - Same with coding, if your fingers aren't on the keyboard your brain isn't learning.
    - Switch from consume mode to create mode.
    - Start to build your own stuff.
3. **Perfection is a trap.**
    - Ugly code that works will teach you more than beautiful code that never leaves your laptop.
4. **You'll never feel ready, start anyway.**
    - You start small, you get stronger over time.
    - Your more ready than you think.
    - Just start.
5. **The real skill is problem solving.**
    - Anyone can memorize a for loop, but can you break down a feature request into tiny buildable chunks?
    - Think of coding like being a detective.
    - The real magic is in asking the right questions, tracing clues, and piecing together the puzzle.
    - stay curious, keep digging, why it's writter that way.
6. **Nobody cares about your code, they care about what it does.**
    - Not your client, not your boss, not your users.
    - They care about the value it provides.
    - The client just wanted results.
    - If the code is clean and elegant too, great, but don't lose sleep over the perfect solution no one sees.
        - Value is better than vanity.
7. **Burnout is real, protect your energy.**
    - Developers 24/7 nonsense
    - Boundaries are healthy.
    - Your job is not your identity.
    - Sustainability: Sleep, eat, exercise, take breaks, go outside, touch grass.
