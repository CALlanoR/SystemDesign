# Section 7: EC2  Instance Storage

Whatâ€™s an EBS  Overview? Network USB  stick

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach  to your instances while they run
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time  
- They are bound to a specific availability zone  
- Not a physical drive
- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to  another one quickly
- To move a  volume  across availability zone, you first need to snapshot it
